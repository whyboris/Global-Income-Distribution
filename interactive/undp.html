        Data Visualization Challenge</a>: <em>Visualize Inequality</em>
      </p>

        Inequality is a broad multifaceted concept that is impossible to reduce to a single number or visualization; to
        understand it better, we must look at numerous perspectives (income, wealth, education, health, access to technology,
        and a multitude more). This data visualization is just a single exploration: a snapshot in time comparing the
        distributions of individual incomes of people within countries and across the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Income is one of the simplest ways to gauge quality of life along numerous dimensions (it correlates highly with
        educational, health, and other desired outcomes). Income is particularly easy to summarize (a single number per person)
        and is relatively straight-forward to compare across people and even nations. Looking at a distribution of incomes
        across a country one can usually gather a pretty accurate picture of life there.
      </p>
      <p>
        The dataset needed for such comparisons comes from Branko Milanovic (2011).<span class="reference-link cursor-initial">[1]</span>
        The data provided included incomes
        measured in the country’s currency and thus required conversion to purchasing power parity (PPP) international dollars;
        this was accomplished with the World Bank dataset for 2011.<span class="reference-link cursor-initial">[2]</span>
        Only 3 countries from the dataset are not present in the
        visualization as there was a small mismatch between the two datasets. All processing steps and the code for generating
        the visualization are publicly available with an MIT license on GitHub.<span class="reference-link cursor-initial">[3]</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        The choice of visualization of the dataset is fully credited to Branko Milanovic. I discovered it and have since seen it
        several times (presentations, articles, and a book). It is an ingenious way of presenting inequalities within countries,
        between countries, and absolute incomes all at once. Comparing some countries, it becomes obvious that even those with
        the lowest incomes in one country fare better than those with the highest income in another country. At the same time,
        another picture emerges: there is no “developing” vs “developed” world, but instead a broad continuum with countries
        steadily improving over the decades.<span class="reference-link cursor-initial">[4]</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        Income inequality is a large political issue in the United States for many. Unfortunately, many of these individuals do
        not have a global picture in mind when thinking about inequality. While differences in income within the United States
        are staggering, global income inequality is worse still. My hope is that being exposed to a more-accurate global view
        will help people in all countries realize some commonalities (inequities that exist within each country), some
        differences (some countries are better at reducing these inequities), and some absolute numbers (just how much worse-off
        financially the lives of the world’s poor are in comparison to the developed world). Perhaps, with luck, some people
        will even start using a fraction of their income to help those who had the bad luck of being born in a worse
        situation.<span class="reference-link cursor-initial">[5]</span>
